If you were asked to name a category of software that has a ton of products in it, task management would certainly be near the top of the list.

There are hundreds if not thousands of task management applications currently on the market. Trello, Asana, Todoist, Monday, and Appleâ€™s Reminders app are just a few of the products in this category. Capterra lists 353 task management products in their marketplace and G2Crowd lists 240.

In addition to all of this existing competition, building a todo app is one of the most popular ways new software developers learn to program, so the amount of competition you would expect to see in this category would only grow over time.
## The Challenge
Building a product that people love to use and are actually willing to pay for in a category with many many competitors.
## The Solution
Performing an exhaustive customer research process and meta analysis of competing products to identify unmet needs of existing users and compelling product features that motivate user adoption and willingness to pay.
## The Work
* User Interviews
* Product Teardowns
* Customer Research Analysis
* Product Spec Writing
## User Interviews
We interviewed 20 current or former task management app users.

We qualified interview subjects by their willingness to pay for task management applications in the past, their authority to make purchasing decisions, and whether they had a history of using task management apps for their business.

We asked users about why they used task management apps and what led them to make their purchasing decisions. When any answers were unclear or could be misinterpreted we asked for more context and clarification.

When users told us about positive or negative feelings towards product experiences, but didn't give us evidence of followup actions they took in response to their emotions, we asked followup questions to validate whether their feelings were strong enough to motivate purchasing decisions.

We recorded and saved user interviews on video. Afterwards, we wrote down key takeaways from each individual interview.

## Product Teardowns
We user tested five of the most popular products in the task management category and created full product teardowns for each application.

We annotated screenshots of key product experiences for each of the 5 task management products. As we used the products, we created notes each time the product failed to work as expected or produced undesirable emotions. These notes were then appended to the screen for each product's experience.

## Customer Research Analysis
We reviewed our user interviews and user testing results and identified mismatches between existing pain points users said they experienced and product offerings of existing task management products.

## Product Strategy
Our customer research identified several key pain points that existing products left unsolved. By working to correctly label these painpoints from the perspective of users we interviewed, we were able to identify key product features that differentiated Terrific Tasks from key task management product competitors.

## Product Spec Writing
We wrote a full and complete product spec that defined the specific user problems we were looking to solve, example use cases, and a potential solution.
