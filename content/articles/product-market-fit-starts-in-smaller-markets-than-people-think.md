One of the biggest mistakes software product companies make is pursuing a larger target market than they can find product-market fit within.

It's an all too common problem that stems from a good place, a positive mindset that's also often the source of great creativity.

Unfortunately, it's also an effort that's greatly misplaced.

When companies pursue larger markets than they their product is specifically suited for, they are met with, at best, mixed signals that throws their business into a state of confusion.

The executive team has trouble identifying the right product use cases, the product team gets asked to build non-complimentary features, the marketing team loses its message, and the business loses as a whole.

Contrast pursuing a large market with a product that hyper focuses on a specific segment of a market population.

Businesses that focus on niche markets not only know who they're targeting, which is something that almost all businesses claim know to anyhow, but also know why people use their product, which is ultimately much more important and is often the separating factor between software product winners and software product losers.
